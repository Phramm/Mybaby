Analysis
There are times when I'm lying in my bed
How I bellow and cry from this stupid gate
And my eyes are like windshields on a rainy day
Almost rubbed-down, swelling
As I keep on dipping my face in these cold hands of mine
Heaven knows how embittered I am
'Cause this angel has flown away from me
Leaving me with drunken misery
I should have clipped her wings
And made her mine for all eternity
Now, this angel has flown away from me
Thought I had the strength to set her free
Did what I did because I love her so
Will she ever find her way back home to me? Oh-oh
I'm so tired, I feel like catching 40 winks
Being up all night in this elbow room
That puts me in a trance
Where hopes and dreams come true
Now, my lips are burning
And my eyes are hurting
From these fumes I make, still, I light another cigarette
Just to pass my time, oh
Heaven knows how embittered I am
'Cause this angel has flown away from me
Leaving me with drunken misery
I should have clipped her wings
And made her mine for all eternity
Now, this angel has flown away from me
Thought I had the strength to set her free
Did what I did because I love her so
Will she ever find her way back home to me? Oh-oh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
